## Weeknote 2

### Work Stuff

Back to sprint and tickets.

Picked up two tickets from an ex-team member (sitemap design updates and article import investigation), merged in the massive editorial article redesign PR to staging and started tidying up the tickets from last year stuck in the Ready for UAT column. 

Wrote up an article on [[Drupal 10: Programmatically creating nodes]] based on the article import investigation work.

### Projects

Began working on the profile page, not much to show yet.

### Enjoyed Reading/Found Interesting

### Everything else

Absolutely gutted at the cancellation of OFMD after just two seasons.

Steadily still going on DDO hardcore, up to level 11 now, close to taking 12. Raid night on the regular server worked very well despite only four attendees (six successful quests).

A couple of AppleFitness strength and yoga sessions, 2 Rockfits and 1 gym session. 

Stuck in an emotional loop of what would I do if I wasn’t a developer (coding is what I do best) and why can’t I stay as a developer (this career path is not stable and how can I give back to society).
